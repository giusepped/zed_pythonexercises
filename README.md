zed_pythonexercises
===================

My first approach with python was at codecademy. While that helped me get some basics, I soon realized 
that I wasn't able to do much really and couldn't figure out how to run code on my computer. So I decided 
to 'learn the hard way' with Zed Shaw's book "Learning Python the hard way". I will keep track of the 
exercises given in the book here.
